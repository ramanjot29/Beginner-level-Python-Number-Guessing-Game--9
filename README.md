# Beginner-level-Python-Number Guessing Game #9
 This Python program allows the user to play a number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 5 using the 'random' module. The user is prompted to enter a guess within this range. If their guess matches the randomly generated number, they win the game; otherwise, the program reveals the correct answer.
