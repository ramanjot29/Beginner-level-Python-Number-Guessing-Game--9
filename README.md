# Number Guessing Game

This Python program is a simple number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 5 using the `random` module. The player is prompted to enter a guess within this range. If their guess matches the randomly generated number, they win the game. Otherwise, the program reveals the correct answer.

------Random Module
The random module in Python provides functions for generating random numbers. 
In this program, we use the randint() function from the random module to generate a random integer between 1 and 5.


## Usage

1. Run the program.

2. Enter your guess when prompted with a message like "Enter your guess (1-5):".

3. If your guess is correct, the program will display "You Win". Otherwise, it will reveal the correct answer.

4. The game will end with the message "Game Over! Thank you for playing."
